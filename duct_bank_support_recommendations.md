## Support Options

### Option 1: Soldier Pile and Lagging with Horizontal Beams (RECOMMENDED)

**Description:**
Install soldier piles on both sides of the duct bank, with horizontal beams/walers spanning across to support the duct bank from below.

**Components:**
- Soldier piles: H-piles or wide-flange beams installed at 1.5-2.0 m spacing along the 25 m length

- Cost: Moderate to high

**Installation Sequence:**
1. Install soldier piles on both sides of duct bank alignment
2. Excavate in stages, installing horizontal beams as excavation progresses
3. Support duct bank on horizontal beams
4. Complete excavation below
5. Remove supports after construction (reverse sequence)

## Recommended Solution: Option 1 (Soldier Pile and Lagging with Horizontal Beams)

### Rationale:
1. **Suitable for soil conditions:** Medium dense sandy silty till provides adequate bearing for soldier piles
2. **Progressive installation:** Allows excavation to proceed in stages
3. **Direct support:** Horizontal beams provide direct support to duct bank
4. **Flexibility:** Can adjust support spacing based on field conditions
5. **Cost-effective:** Reusable materials, moderate installation cost
6. **No groundwater concerns:** Simplifies installation

### Design Considerations:

**Load Analysis:**
- Duct bank weight: ~27.3 tonnes total (1.09 tonnes per linear meter)
- Soil surcharge above duct bank: ~1.3 m fill + 0.7 m till = 2.0 m
- Estimated surcharge pressure: ~40-50 kPa
- Total design load: ~2.0-2.5 tonnes per linear meter (with safety factor)

**Support Spacing:**
- Soldier piles: 1.5-2.0 m spacing along 25 m length (13-17 piles per side)
- Horizontal beams: 1.0-1.5 m vertical spacing
- Beam size: W8×31 or W10×33 minimum (check with structural engineer)

**Installation Depth:**
- Soldier pile embedment: Minimum 2.0 m below final excavation (to 7.0 m total depth)
- Pile type: HP10×42 or HP12×53 (check capacity)

**Construction Sequence:**
1. Survey and mark duct bank location
2. Install soldier piles on both sides (offset 0.5-1.0 m from duct bank edges)
3. Excavate in 0.5-1.0 m lifts
4. Install horizontal support beams as excavation progresses
5. Place temporary supports under duct bank at beam locations
6. Complete excavation to final grade
7. Perform construction work
8. Backfill in stages, removing supports progressively
9. Remove soldier piles (if temporary)

## Alternative: Option 2 (Temporary Steel Frame) - If Quick Installation Required

If time is critical and excavation bottom is stable, Option 2 may be faster:

**Modified Approach:**
- Install vertical posts at 2.0 m spacing along 25 m length
- Use W12×40 or larger beams spanning 6 m width
- Support posts on concrete pads or spread footings
- Design for 2.5-3.0 tonnes per linear meter load

## Safety and Quality Considerations

1. **Monitoring:**
   - Survey duct bank for settlement/movement during excavation
   - Monitor soldier pile deflection
   - Check beam deflections
   - Target: <10 mm settlement acceptable

2. **Temporary Supports:**
   - Use timber blocking or steel shims between beams and duct bank
   - Ensure uniform contact and load distribution
   - Check for point loading

3. **Excavation Control:**
   - Excavate in stages (max 1.0-1.5 m per stage)
   - Install supports before next excavation stage
   - Maintain safe slopes for unsupported areas

4. **Load Testing:**
   - Consider proof loading of support system
   - Verify actual loads match design assumptions

5. **Professional Engineering:**
   - Engage structural engineer for detailed design
   - Geotechnical engineer for soil-structure interaction
   - Construction engineer for installation sequence

## Conclusion

For the given conditions (25 m length, 6 m wide excavation, medium dense soil, no groundwater), **Option 1 (Soldier Pile and Lagging with Horizontal Beams)** is recommended as the primary solution. It provides reliable support, allows progressive excavation, and is cost-effective for this application.

**Option 2 (Temporary Steel Frame)** is a viable alternative if faster installation is required and the excavation bottom provides adequate bearing capacity.

Both options should be designed by a qualified structural engineer with consideration of:
- Actual soil properties from geotechnical report
- Duct bank structural capacity
- Construction loads and sequencing
- Local building codes and regulations
